<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When by the changeless Power of a Supreme Decree</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The poet issues forth upon this sorry sphere,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His mother, horrified, and full of blasphemy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Uplifts her voice to God, who takes compassion on her.</span><br />
<br />
"Ah, why did I not bear a serpent's nest entire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Instead of bringing forth this hideous Child of Doom!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh cursèd be that transient night of vain desire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When I conceived my expiation in my womb!"</span><br />
<br />
"Yet since among all women thou hast chosen me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To be the degradation of my jaded mate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And since I cannot like a love-leaf wantonly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Consign this stunted monster to the glowing grate,"</span><br />
<br />
"I'll cause thine overwhelming hatred to rebound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Upon the cursèd tool of thy most wicked spite.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Forsooth, the branches of this wretched tree I'll wound</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And rob its pestilential blossoms of their might!"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So thus, she giveth vent unto her foaming ire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And knowing not the changeless statutes of all times,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Herself, amid the flames of hell, prepares the pyre;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The consecrated penance of maternal crimes.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yet 'neath th' invisible shelter of an Angel's wing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This sunlight-loving infant disinherited,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Exhales from all he eats and drinks, and everything</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The ever sweet ambrosia and the nectar red.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He trifles with the winds and with the clouds that glide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">About the way unto the Cross, he loves to sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The spirit on his pilgrimage; that faithful guide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oft weeps to see him joyful like a bird of Spring.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All those that he would cherish shrink from him with fear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And some that waxen bold by his tranquility,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Endeavour hard some grievance from his heart to tear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And make on him the trial of their ferocity.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Within the bread and wine outspread for his repast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To mingle dust and dirty spittle they essay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And everything he touches, forth they slyly cast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or scourge themselves, if e'er their feet betrod his way.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His wife goes round proclaiming in the crowded quads&mdash;</span><br />
"Since he can find my body beauteous to behold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Why not perform the office of those ancient gods</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And like unto them, redeck myself with shining gold?"</span><br />
<br />
"I'll bathe myself with incense, spikenard and myrrh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With genuflexions, delicate viandes and wine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To see, in jest, if from a heart, that loves me dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I cannot filch away the hommages divine."</span><br />
<br />
"And when of these impious jokes at length I tire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My frail but mighty hands, around his breast entwined,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With nails, like harpies' nails, shall cunningly conspire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The hidden path unto his feeble heart to find."</span><br />
<br />
"And like a youngling bird that trembles in its nest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll pluck his heart right out; within its own blood drowned,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And finally to satiate my favourite beast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll throw it with intense disdain upon the ground!"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Towards the Heavens where he sees the sacred grail</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The poet calmly stretches forth his pious arms,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whereon the lightenings from his lucid spirit veil</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The sight of the infuriated mob that swarms.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh blest be thou, Almighty who bestowest pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Like some divine redress for our infirmities,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And like the most refreshing and the purest rain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To sanctify the strong, for saintly ecstasies."</span><br />
<br />
"I know that for the poet thou wilt grant a chair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Among the Sainted Legion and the Blissful ones,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That of the endless feast thou wilt accord his share</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To him, of Virtues, Dominations and of Thrones."</span><br />
<br />
"I know, that Sorrow is that nobleness alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which never may corrupted be by hell nor curse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I know, in order to enwreathe my mystic crown</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I must inspire the ages and the universe."</span><br />
<br />
"And yet the buried jewels of Palmyra old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The undiscovered metals and the pearly sea</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of gems, that unto me you show could never hold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beside this diadem of blinding brilliancy."</span><br />
<br />
"For it shall be engendered from the purest fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of rays primeval, from the holy hearth amassed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of which the eyes of Mortals, in their sheen entire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Are but the tarnished mirrors, sad and overcast!"</span><br />

<h3><a name="Echoes" id="Echoes"></a>Echoes</h3>


<p class="margin-b">
In Nature's temple, living columns rise,<br />
Which oftentimes give tongue to words subdued,<br />
And Man traverses this symbolic wood,<br />
Which looks at him with half familiar eyes,<br />
<br />
Like lingering echoes, which afar confound<br />
Themselves in deep and sombre unity,<br />
As vast as Night, and like transplendency,<br />
The scents and colours to each other respond.<br />
<br />
And scents there are, like infant's flesh as chaste,<br />
As sweet as oboes, and as meadows fair,<br />
And others, proud, corrupted, rich and vast,<br />
<br />
Which have the expansion of infinity,<br />
Like amber, musk and frankincense and myrrh,<br />
That sing the soul's and senses' ecstasy.<br />

Alas&mdash;my poor Muse&mdash;what aileth thee now?<br />
Thine eyes are bedimmed with the visions of Night,<br />
And silent and cold&mdash;I perceive on thy brow<br />
In their turns&mdash;Despair and Madness alight.<br />
<br />
A succubus green, or a hobgoblin red,<br />
Has it poured o'er thee Horror and Love from its urn?<br />
Or the Nightmare with masterful bearing hath led<br />
Thee to drown in the depths of some magic Minturne?<br />
<br />
I wish, as the health-giving fragrance I cull,<br />
That thy breast with strong thoughts could for ever be full,<br />
And that rhymthmic'ly flowing&mdash;thy Christian blood<br />
<br />
Could resemble the olden-time metrical-flood,<br />
Where each in his turn reigned the father of Rhymes<br />
Phoebus&mdash;and Pan, lord of Harvest-times.<br />

<p class="margin-b">
Oh Muse of my heart&mdash;so fond of palaces old,<br />
Wilt have&mdash;when New Year speeds its wintry blast,<br />
Amid those tedious nights, with snow o'ercast,<br />
A log to warm thy feet, benumbed with cold?<br />
<br />
Wilt thou thy marbled shoulders then revive<br />
With nightly rays that through thy shutters peep?<br />
And&mdash;void thy purse and void thy palace&mdash;reap<br />
A golden hoard within some azure hive?<br />
<br />
Thou must, to earn thy daily bread, each night,<br />
Suspend the censer like an acolyte,<br />
Te-Deums sing, with sanctimonious ease,<br />
<br />
Or as a famished mountebank, with jokes obscene<br />
Essay to lull the vulgar rabble's spleen;<br />
Thy laughter soaked in tears which no one sees.<br />

The cloisters old, expounded on their walls<br />
With paintings, the Beatic Verity,<br />
The which&mdash;adorning their religious halls,<br />
Enriched the frigidness of their Austerity.<br />

In days when Christian seeds bloomed o'er the land,<br />
Full many a noble monk unknown to-day,<br />
Upon the field of tombs would take his stand,<br />
Exalting Death in rude and simple way.<br />
<br />
My soul is a tomb where&mdash;bad monk that I be&mdash;<br />
I dwell and search its depths from all eternity,<br />
And nought bedecks the walls of the odious spot.<br />

Oh sluggard monk! when shall I glean aright<br />

To mold my handywork and mine eyes' Delight?<br />

<p class="margin-b">
My childhood was nought but a ravaging storm,<br />
Enlivened at times by a brilliant sun;<br />
The rain and the winds wrought such havoc and harm<br />
That of buds on my plot there remains hardly one.<br />
<br />
Behold now the Fall of ideas I have reached,<br />
And the shovel and rake one must therefore resume,<br />
In collecting the turf, inundated and breached,<br />
Where the waters dug trenches as deep as a tomb.<br />
<br />
And yet these new blossoms, for which I craved,<br />
Will they find in this earth&mdash;like a shore that is laved&mdash;<br />
The mystical fuel which vigour imparts?<br />
<br />
Oh misery!&mdash;Time devours our lives,<br />
And the enemy black, which consumeth our hearts<br />
On the blood of our bodies, increases and thrives!<br />

This heavy burden to uplift,<br />
O Sysiphus, thy pluck is required!<br />
And even though the heart aspired,<br />
Art is long and Time is swift.<br />
<br />
Afar from sepulchres renowned,<br />
To a graveyard, quite apart,<br />
Like a broken drum, my heart,<br />
Beats the funeral marches' sound.<br />
<br />
Many a buried jewel sleeps<br />
In the long-forgotten deeps,<br />
Far from mattock and from sound;<br />
<br />
Many a flower wafts aloft<br />
Its perfumes, like a secret soft,<br />
Within the solitudes, profound.<br />

A long while I dwelt beneath vast porticoes,<br />
While the ocean-suns bathed with a thousand fires,<br />
And which with their great and majestic spires,<br />
At eventide looked like basaltic grottoes.<br />
<br />
The billows, in rolling depictured the skies,<br />
And mingled, in solemn and mystical strain,<br />
The all-mighteous chords of their luscious refrain<br />
With the sun-set's colours reflexed in mine eyes.<br />
<br />
It is there that I lived in exalted calm,<br />
In the midst of the azure, the splendour, the waves,<br />
While pregnant with perfumes, naked slaves<br />
<br />
Refreshed my forehead with branches of palm,<br />
Whose gentle and only care was to know<br />
The secret that caused me to languish so.<br />

Free man! the sea is to thee ever dear!<br />
The sea is thy mirror, thou regardest thy soul<br />
In its mighteous waves that unendingly roll,<br />
And thy spirit is yet not a chasm less drear.<br />
<br />
Thou delight'st to plunge deep in thine image down;<br />
Thou tak'st it with eyes and with arms in embrace,<br />
And at times thine own inward voice would'st efface<br />
With the sound of its savage ungovernable moan.<br />
<br />
You are both of you, sombre, secretive and deep:<br />
Oh mortal, thy depths are foraye unexplored,<br />
Oh sea&mdash;no one knoweth thy dazzling hoard,<br />
You both are so jealous your secrets to keep!<br />
<br />
And endless ages have wandered by,<br />
Yet still without pity or mercy you fight,<br />
So mighty in plunder and death your delight:<br />
Oh wrestlers! so constant in enmity!<br />

I am lovely, O mortals, like a dream of stone,<br />
And my bosom, where each one gets bruised in turn,<br />
To inspire the love of a poet is prone,<br />
Like matter eternally silent and stern.<br />

As an unfathomed sphinx, enthroned by the Nile,<br />
My heart a swan's whiteness with granite combines,<br />
And I hate every movement, displacing the lines,<br />
And never I weep and never I smile.<br />
<br />
The poets in front of mine attitudes fine<br />

Two mirrors, which Beauty in all things ignite:<br />

It could ne'er be those beauties of ivory vignettes;<br />

His hospital-beauties in troups that whirl,<br />

A flower to resemble my scarlet ideal.<br />

Since, what for this fathomless heart I require<br />
Is&mdash;Lady Macbeth you! in crime so dire;<br />
&mdash;An Æschylus dream transposed from the South&mdash;<br />

To see her body flowering with her soul,<br />
And grow, unchained, in awe-inspiring art,<br />
Within the mists across her eyes that stole<br />
To divine the fires entombed within her heart.<br />
<br />
And oft to scramble o'er her mighty limbs,<br />
And climb the slopes of her enormous knees,<br />
Or in summer when the scorching sunlight streams<br />
<br />
Across the country, to recline at ease,<br />
And slumber in the shadow of her breast<br />
Like an hamlet 'neath the mountain-crest.<br />

O Beauty! dost thou generate from Heaven or from Hell?<br />
Within thy glance, so diabolic and divine,<br />
Confusedly both wickedness and goodness dwell,<br />
And hence one might compare thee unto sparkling wine.<br />
<br />
Thy look containeth both the dawn and sunset stars,<br />
Thy perfumes, as upon a sultry night exhale,<br />
Thy kiss a philter, and thy mouth a Grecian vase,<br />
That renders heroes cowardly and infants hale.<br />
<br />
Yea, art thou from the planets, or the fiery womb?<br />
The demon follows in thy train, with magic fraught,<br />
Thou scatter'st seeds haphazardly of joy and doom,<br />
Thou govern'st everything, but answer'st unto nought.<br />
<br />
O Loveliness! thou spurnest corpses with delight,<br />
Among thy jewels, Horror hath such charms for thee,<br />
And Murder 'mid thy mostly cherished trinklets bright,<br />
Upon thy massive bosom dances amorously.<br />
<br />
The blinded, fluttering moth towards the candle flies,<br />
Then frizzles, falls, and falters&mdash;"Blessings unto thee"&mdash;<br />
The panting swain that o'er his beauteous mistress sighs,<br />
Seems like the Sick, that stroke their gravestones lovingly.<br />
<br />
What matter, if thou comest from the Heavens or Hell,<br />
O Beauty, frightful ghoul, ingenuous and obscure!<br />
So long thine eyes, thy smile, to me the way can tell<br />
Towards that Infinite I love, but never saw.<br />
<br />
From God or Satan? Angel, Mermaid, Proserpine?<br />
What matter if thou makest&mdash;blithe, voluptuous sprite&mdash;<br />
With rhythms, perfumes, visions&mdash;O mine only queen!&mdash;<br />
The universe less hideous and the hours less trite.<br />

When, with closed eyes, on a hot afternoon,<br />
The scent of thine ardent breast I inhale,<br />
Celestial vistas my spirit assail;<br />
Caressed by the flames of an endless sun.<br />
<br />
A langorous island, where Nature abounds<br />
With exotic trees and luscious fruit;<br />
And with men whose bodies are slim and astute,<br />
And with women whose frankness delights and astounds.<br />
<br />
By thy perfume enticed to this region remote,<br />
A port I see, laden with mast and with boat,<br />
Still wearied and torn by the distant brine;<br />
<br />
While the tamarisk-odours that dreamily throng<br />
The air, round my slumberous senses intwine,<br />
And mix, in my soul, with the mariners' song.<br />

O fleece, that foams down unto the shoulders bare!<br />
O curls, O scents which lovely languidness exhale!<br />
Delight! to fill this alcove's sombre atmosphere<br />

<br />
The shores of Africa, and Asia's burning skies,<br />
A world forgotten, distant, nearly dead and spent,<br />
Within thy depths, O aromatic forest! lies.<br />
And like to spirits floating unto melodies,<br />
Mine own, Belovèd! glides within thy sacred scent.<br />

There I will hasten, where the trees and humankind<br />
With languor lull beside the hot and silent sea;<br />
Strong tresses bear me, be to me the waves and wind!<br />
Within thy fragrance lies a dazzling dream confined<br />
Of sails and masts and flames&mdash;O lake of ebony!<br />
<br />
A loudly echoing harbour, where my soul may hold<br />
To quaff, the silver cup of colours, scents and sounds,<br />
Wherein the vessels glide upon a sea of gold,<br />
And stretch their mighty arms, the glory to enfold<br />
Of virgin skies, where never-ending heat abounds.<br />
<br />
I'll plunge my brow, enamoured with voluptuousness<br />
Within this darkling ocean of infinitude,<br />
Until my subtle spirit, which thy waves caress,<br />
Shall find you once again, O fertile weariness;<br />
Unending lullabye of perfumed lassitude!<br />
<br />
Ye tresses blue&mdash;recess of strange and sombre shades,<br />
Ye make the azure of the starry Realm immense;<br />
Upon the downy beeches, by your curls' cascades,<br />
Among your mingling fragrances, my spirit wades<br />
To cull the musk and cocoa-nut and lotus scents.<br />
<br />
Long&mdash;foraye&mdash;my hand, within thy heavy mane,<br />
Shall scatter rubies, pearls, sapphires eternally,<br />
And thus my soul's desire for thee shall never wane;<br />
For art not thou the oasis where I dream and drain<br />
With draughts profound, the golden wine of memory?<br />
